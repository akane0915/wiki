      <p>Vertumnus is a painting completed by the Mannerist painter Giuseppe Arcimboldo in Milan c. 1590–1591. It depicts the Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II as Vertumnus, the Roman god of metamorphoses in nature and life. The fruits and vegetables symbolize the abundance of the Golden Age that had returned under the Emperor's rule. The painting is now held at Skokloster Castle.</p>
